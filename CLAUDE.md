# Pumpvision — Project Briefing

## What This Project Is

Pumpvision is a mobile-first management and operations platform for an IndianOil retail outlet (RO).
The outlet is **Shree Petroleum**, RO code **206858**, located in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh, India.
It is operated by the dealer's family (owner: father + son Rishab).

The goal is to give the owners a 360-degree real-time view of:
- Daily fuel sales and revenue (by product, by nozzle)
- Stock levels and delivery tracking
- Payment collection breakdown (cash vs card/UPI vs credit vs fleet card)
- Anomaly and theft detection
- Credit customer ledger and invoicing

The project is built with vibe coding (no professional software engineering background).
If successful, it will be sold as SaaS to other IndianOil (and HPCL/BPCL) dealers.

**Competitive context:** PetroByte is the main mobile-capable competitor (~₹3,990/year).
Pumpvision's differentiation: automated IRAS data ingestion, owner-first design, IOC-native
integration, distinct visual identity. Market: ~100,000 petrol pumps in India.

## Products Sold at This Outlet

| Code | Full Name | Type | Data Source |
|------|-----------|------|-------------|
| HS | High Speed Diesel (HSD) | Diesel | IRAS ISS + nozzle map |
| MS | Motor Spirit | Petrol | IRAS ISS + nozzle map |
| X2 | Xtra Premium 95 (XP95) | Premium Petrol | IRAS ISS + nozzle map |
| XG | Xtra Green | Bio Diesel | IRAS ISS + nozzle map |
| CNG | Compressed Natural Gas | Gas | SDMS PAD scraper (CGD Rewa billing row, kg) — display source |

**CNG is active — not deferred.** CNG does not appear in IRAS nozzle or ISS tables.
**Display source:** `_cng_sdms()` in dashboard routes — reads `sdms_summaries` DB table first (Railway
production source of truth); falls back to local `data/sdms/sdms_pad_{date}_summary.json` for
local/debug compatibility. SDMS JSON files are local/debug artifacts only, not the production source.
**Attendant entries** (`cng_shift_readings`) are still collected at shift close and stored — kept for
future cross-checks — but are NOT used for dashboard or summary display.

---

## Payment Modes

- **Cash** — derived remainder; never recorded directly
- **Card + UPI** — Paytm POS machines; data from Paytm scraper
- **Credit** — fleet/institutional customers
- **Fleet card** — IOCL depot account; data from SDMS PAD scraper — **no manager entry needed**

### Payment Reconciliation Formula
```
Gross fuel sales (liquid fuel litres × RSP  +  CNG kg × RSP/kg)
+ Lube sales (cash component)
= Total revenue

Total revenue
= Cash (derived)
+ Paytm UPI + Card
+ Credit extended
+ Fleet card (SDMS PAD data)

Cash = Total revenue − Paytm − Credit − Fleet card
```

Fleet card swipes settle to the IOCL depot account (separate ledger from bank account).
Depot account reconciliation deferred to Stage 3.

---

## Three-User Model

One Flask app, one DB, one deployment. Role set at login via `users.role`.

### Owner (father / Rishab)
Dashboard, Daily Summary, Tanks, Credit management.
Reviews daily P&L, browses historical summaries, manages credit customers,
confirms bank transfer payments.

### Manager
Shift-contextual daily task checklist. Prescriptive — app tells him what to do.
**Stage 1:** Log expenses · Record payments received.
**Stage 2:** Log lube sales · Generate invoices.
**Does not log fleet card swipes** — fleet data comes from SDMS PAD scraper.

### Attendant
Credit sale flow · Shift close flow (including CNG totalizer reading).

## Hardware at the Outlet

### Underground Tanks
| Tank | Product | Capacity |
|------|---------|----------|
| 1 | HS | 20,000 L |
| 2 | MS | 20,000 L |
| 3 | X2 | 10,000 L |
| 4 | XG | 20,000 L |

All tanks: GVR MAG PLUS ATG probes. ATG refreshes every 30 minutes.
Tank 4 (XG): probe historically unreliable — data stored; UI warning not currently shown.
CNG has no underground tank.

### Liquid Fuel Nozzles
| DU | Pump | Nozzle | Product | Tank | Label |
|----|------|--------|---------|------|-------|
| 9 (MIDCO) | 1 | 7 | HS | 1 | HS1 |
| 9 (MIDCO) | 2 | 11 | XG | 4 | XG |
| 14 (MIDCO) | 3 | 17 | X2 | 3 | X2 |
| 14 (MIDCO) | 4 | 18 | MS | 2 | MS1 |
| 15 (GILBARCO) | 5 | 15 | MS | 2 | MS2 |
| 15 (GILBARCO) | 6 | 16 | HS | 1 | HS2 |

Only DU 9 has receipt printers. NPND interlock disabled on all pumps.

### CNG Dispenser
One nozzle. Not in IRAS. No ISS records. Unit: kg. RSP: static (`cng_rsp_per_kg` in `app_settings`).
Attendant label: **CNG** (no suffix — single nozzle).
No pump test deduction for CNG.

---

## CNG — Full Implementation Spec

### Data Sources (two separate streams)

**Display (dashboard + summary):** `_cng_sdms(op_date)` in `blueprints/dashboard/routes.py`.
Queries `sdms_summaries` DB table first (Railway production source of truth).
Falls back to `data/sdms/sdms_pad_{date}_summary.json` for local/debug compatibility.
Returns a `SimpleNamespace(kg_sold, rsp_per_kg, revenue)` so templates need no changes.
Returns `None` if no SDMS data for the date or `cng_kg_total ≤ 0`.
RSP source: `CNG_RSP_PER_KG` env var (default `93.40`) — stored in `sdms_summaries` row at scrape time.

**Attendant entry (stored, not displayed):** `cng_shift_readings` table. Collected at shift close.
Kept for future cross-checks and variance analysis. Not used by any dashboard route.

### How attendant entry works
The attendant enters the CNG meter reading (in kg) at shift close, exactly like liquid fuel.
Opening reading for day N = closing reading from day N−1. First-ever entry: manual opening.

### Schema: `cng_shift_readings` ✓ built (migration `2fc50a7d52a6`)
| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | Integer PK | |
| op_date | Date NOT NULL | Operational date |
| opening_reading | Float NOT NULL | Meter kg at 06:00 |
| closing_reading | Float NOT NULL | Meter kg at shift close |
| kg_sold | Float NOT NULL | closing − opening (computed) |
| rsp_per_kg | Float NOT NULL | Snapshot of `cng_rsp_per_kg` at entry time |
| revenue | Float NOT NULL | kg_sold × rsp_per_kg |
| submitted_by | Integer FK → users | |
| created_at | DateTime | |

### RSP
Static value: `CNG_RSP_PER_KG` env var (default `93.40`). Stored in SDMS JSON at scrape time.
Also mirrored to `app_settings` key `cng_rsp_per_kg` for attendant shift close RSP snapshot.
No IRAS price lookup. CNG RSP does not appear in the Price (PRM) table.

### Shift Close Flow
CNG appears as a 5th product tile on the product selection screen.
Selecting CNG → numpad directly (no DU selection step, same pattern as X2/XG).
Numpad unit label: **kg** (not L). Delta label: **kg sold**.
CNG row appears in shift close summary. Invalid if closing < opening → warn-100 block.

### Daily Summary
CNG row in FUEL SALES section:
`CNG  [kg_sold] kg  ×  ₹[rsp]/kg  =  ₹[revenue]`
Included in GROSS FUEL SALES subtotal.

---

## Data Sources

### Primary: IRAS Portal
**URL:** https://iras.iocliras.in · **Creds:** `.env` · **Automation:** Playwright (`scrapers/`)

ISS tab: 30-min export limit. Boundary mode (built) gives 06:00 totalizer readings.
Full 48-window scrape deferred to Stage 3.

#### IRAS Tables Used
| Tab | Sheet | Contents | Freq |
|-----|-------|----------|------|
| FCC > Product(PDM) | Product(PDM) | Code → name | Static |
| FCC > Tank(TKM) | Tank | Capacity, ATG details | Static |
| FCC > Pump | Pump | DU config | Static |
| FCC > Nozzle | Nozzle | Nozzle → pump → tank → product | Static |
| FCC > Price(PRM) | Price(PDM) | RSP per liquid fuel product | Daily 06:00 |
| FCC > Issue(ISS) | Issue(ISS) | Every liquid fuel transaction | Per transaction |
| FCC > Stock | Stock | ATG tank level snapshots | Every 30 min |
| FCC > Shift Totalizer | Shift Totalizer Record | Nozzle open/close totalizers | Daily |
| RDB > Invoice | RDB SAP Invoice | Depot invoice + density | Per delivery |
| FCC > SAP Invoice | SAP Invoice | Chamber breakdown, truck no. | Per delivery |
| FCC > Receipt | TT Receipt | Decanting: ATG pre/post | Per delivery |
| FCC > Receipt Density | Receipt Density Records | Hydrometer per chamber | Per delivery |
| FCC > Density Records | Density Records | Post-decant ATG density | Per delivery |

### ATG Scraper ✓ Built
`scrapers/iras_atg_exporter.py`. Scrapes IRAS Stock tab. Stores snapshots in `tank_readings`
table every 30 minutes. Integrated into `daily_scrape.py` as Job 5.
XG data: stored with `is_reliable = False`.
**Production data backfill pending** — `tank_readings` has 0 rows on Railway until scraper
is run locally against the Railway PostgreSQL `DATABASE_URL`.

### Paytm for Business
`scrapers/paytm_exporter.py` — headless Playwright, stealth. Job 0 in `daily_scrape.py`.
Downloads previous operational day's transaction CSV from `dashboard.paytm.com`.
Session: `scrapers/paytm_state.json`.

**OTP handling:** Paytm sends login OTP via SMS and email. The scraper reads it automatically
from Gmail using IMAP (`imaplib.IMAP4_SSL`, `GMAIL_ADDRESS` + `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` env vars).
Searches for `UNSEEN FROM "care@paytm.com" SUBJECT "One Time Password"`, skips emails > 600s old,
marks as Seen after extraction. If the saved session is still valid, OTP step is skipped entirely.

**Auto-import to DB:** After a successful CSV download, `_job_paytm()` in `daily_scrape.py`
automatically imports the CSV into the `paytm_transactions` table (insert-or-skip by `paytm_txn_id`).
No manual upload step needed.

**"Files to Download" panel:** The panel on the Paytm dashboard is collapsed by default.
Selectors `a[download]` find nothing until it is expanded. The scraper expands it via click
(step 6b), re-expands every 10 s during the download poll, and uses broad fallback selectors
(`a[href*="s3.amazonaws.com"]`, `a[href*="s3-ap-southeast"]`, `a[href*="s3-us-east"]`) in addition
to `a[download]` to detect the download link.

**Paytm download is not fully reliable.** Report generation or download can fail silently.
If the CSV already exists on disk, import it directly without re-downloading:
```
python -X utf8 scrapers/import_paytm_csv.py data/paytm/paytm_YYYY-MM-DD.csv
```
`scrapers/import_paytm_csv.py` reuses the existing parser (`_parse_paytm_csv`), skips rows with
duplicate `paytm_txn_id`, and is idempotent — safe to run multiple times on the same file.
Does not attempt any Paytm login or download.

### SDMS PAD Portal
`scrapers/sdms_pad_exporter.py` — headless Playwright, Claude Vision CAPTCHA. Job 4.
Fleet card posting totals + CSV. Session: `scrapers/sdms_state.json`.

**CNG extraction:** The scraper also extracts CNG sales from CGD Rewa billing rows.
Detection: `plant.upper().startswith("CGD")` AND `unit.upper() == "KG"`.
`compute_cng_summary(rows)` returns `(kg_total, revenue, count)`.
Output JSON includes: `cng_kg_total`, `cng_revenue`, `cng_rsp_per_kg`, `cng_count`.
RSP used: `CNG_RSP_PER_KG` env var (default `93.40`).

**DB persistence:** After each successful run, `save_summary_to_db()` upserts a `SdmsSummary`
row (idempotent by `op_date`). DB write is skipped if `DATABASE_URL` is not set or `--dry-run`
is active. SDMS JSON files are local/debug artifacts — `sdms_summaries` is the Railway
production source. `_fleet_total()` and `_cng_sdms()` in `dashboard/routes.py` read DB first.

---

## Scraper Orchestration Modes

### `--completed-shift` (production daily use)

```
python -X utf8 scrapers/daily_scrape.py --completed-shift --date YYYY-MM-DD
```

`--date` means **accounting op_date** (shift start date).
Example: `--date 2026-05-20` covers the completed shift `2026-05-20 06:00 → 2026-05-21 05:59`.

What it coordinates:
1. Opening boundary date = `--date` (e.g. 2026-05-20)
2. Closing boundary date = `--date + 1` (e.g. 2026-05-21)
3. Paytm for the shift window `--date 06:00 → (--date + 1) 05:59`
4. Price (PRM) for `op_date = --date`
5. SDMS PAD for `op_date = --date`
6. ATG: **not run** — see ATG rule below

One IRAS login covers Price + any needed boundary scrapes (no second CAPTCHA solve).
Add `--dry-run` to preview what would run/skip without writing to DB.

**Accounting source skips:** Paytm, Price, and SDMS are each checked against the DB before
running. Sources already present are skipped automatically. See *Accounting Source Existence
Checks* below.

**IRAS failure isolation:** If IRAS login fails (CAPTCHA failure), Price and boundary scrapes
are skipped but SDMS still runs independently. The run returns a non-zero exit if any source
failed.

### Boundary Completeness Check

Before scraping each boundary, `--completed-shift` checks `nozzle_totalizers`.
A boundary is **complete** only if all six expected nozzle numbers are present:
`{7, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18}` — all liquid-fuel nozzles per hardware spec.

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| COMPLETE | All 6 nozzles present | Skip — do not re-scrape |
| INCOMPLETE | Some nozzles present, some missing | Scrape — partial is not sufficient |
| MISSING | No rows for this date | Scrape |

The check uses SQLAlchemy Core directly (`create_engine` + `select`). It does **not** call
`create_app()`, so it never triggers `db.create_all()`, Alembic migrations, or seed logic.
Safe to call with `--dry-run`.

### Accounting Source Existence Checks

Before running any accounting source (Paytm / Price / SDMS), `--completed-shift`,
`--accounting-only`, and all `--*-only` modes check the DB using SQLAlchemy Core
(`create_engine` + `select`). No `create_app()`, no migrations, no seed logic. Safe
with `--dry-run`.

| Source | Table checked | Completeness rule |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Paytm | `paytm_transactions` | `COUNT(*) WHERE operational_date = D > 0` |
| Price | `iras_prices` | `SELECT DISTINCT product` set = `{HS, MS, X2, XG}` |
| SDMS | `sdms_summaries` | Row exists AND (`cng_kg_total > 0` OR date older than `SDMS_CNG_LOOKBACK_DAYS = 3`) |

**SDMS CNG lookback (added 14 Jul 2026):** CGD Rewa posts its CNG billing row to the PAD
statement **days after** the op_date (observed: 07-11 empty on 12 Jul, populated by 14 Jul).
A `sdms_summaries` row with no CNG figure is `INCOMPLETE` for 3 days and re-scraped
(idempotent upsert refreshes it); after 3 days a zero-CNG day is accepted as final →
`COMPLETE`. `--completed-shift` additionally re-checks the 3 prior op_dates each run
(lookback re-scrapes appear in the final summary; already-complete lookback dates are
silent). To force a re-scrape of an older date, call
`sdms_pad_exporter.run(target_date='YYYY-MM-DD')` directly — there is no CLI date flag.

**Price completeness uses set logic, not row count.** A date with only HS and MS rows
is `INCOMPLETE`, not `COMPLETE`. Duplicate rows do not cause a false pass.
Status values: `COMPLETE` (skip) · `INCOMPLETE` (re-scrape) · `MISSING` (scrape).
Only `COMPLETE` is treated as a skip — any other status triggers re-scraping.

CNG is not in the IRAS Price table and is not part of the Price existence check.

**Skipped = successful.** A source that is already in DB does not degrade the final
exit status. Only actively-failed sources cause a non-zero exit.

### Source-Specific Retry Modes

Single-source retry without touching unrelated portals. Use when one source failed in a
`--completed-shift` run and the others already succeeded.

```
# Retry Paytm only
python -X utf8 scrapers/daily_scrape.py --paytm-only --date 2026-05-20

# Retry Price only (requires IRAS login)
python -X utf8 scrapers/daily_scrape.py --price-only --date 2026-05-20

# Retry SDMS only
python -X utf8 scrapers/daily_scrape.py --sdms-only --date 2026-05-20
```

For all three modes, `--date` is the **accounting op_date** (shift start date), not the
shift boundary date. `--date 2026-05-20` covers the shift window `2026-05-20 06:00 →
2026-05-21 05:59`.

Each mode runs its existence check first and skips silently if the data is already in DB.
No IRAS login is attempted by `--paytm-only` or `--sdms-only`. `--price-only` defers the
IRAS credential check to runtime — if all four products are already present, no login occurs.

**Rationale:** IRAS CAPTCHA failures are an operational reality. If SDMS succeeds and IRAS
fails, retry with `--price-only` (or `--boundary-only`) without re-running Paytm or SDMS.
Minimises unnecessary portal hits and avoids redundant data duplication.

### Failure Isolation

Each source runs in its own browser context. A failure in one source does not abort others.

| Failure | Behaviour |
|---------|-----------|
| Paytm download fails | Warning printed; Price and SDMS still run |
| IRAS login fails (CAPTCHA) | Price and boundaries marked failed; SDMS still runs |
| SDMS download fails | Warning printed; final summary shows failed |
| DB save fails (any source) | Source marked failed; other sources unaffected |

**Final summary** is printed after all sources complete:

```
=======================================================
  ACCOUNTING SOURCE SUMMARY
=======================================================
  op_date 2026-05-20:
    paytm   : SUCCEEDED
    price   : SUCCEEDED
    sdms    : SKIPPED (already in DB)
=======================================================
```

`run()` returns `False` (non-zero exit) if any source shows `FAILED`. `SKIPPED` is not
a failure. If the process exits non-zero, check the summary above to see which source failed,
then use the corresponding `--*-only` flag to retry that source alone.

### Paytm Wait and Debug Options

| Flag | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| _(not set)_ | Paytm download waits up to the scraper's built-in timeout |
| `--paytm-wait-seconds N` (N > 0) | Poll for download link for up to N seconds |
| `--paytm-wait-seconds 0` | Poll indefinitely (use with caution) |
| `--paytm-wait-seconds N` (N < 0) | Rejected — script exits with error |

```
python -X utf8 scrapers/daily_scrape.py --completed-shift --date 2026-05-20 --paytm-wait-seconds 120
```

`--paytm-debug` saves diagnostic artifacts to the working directory:
- `paytm_page.html` — full page HTML at the time of the download attempt
- `paytm_anchors.txt` — all anchor hrefs found on the page
- `paytm_candidates.txt` — candidate download link(s) evaluated
- `network.log` — network requests observed (URLs sanitized — query strings stripped)
- `paytm_debug.png` — screenshot at the time of the download attempt

**Security note:** Page HTML, anchor lists, and candidate-link files may contain signed
S3 URLs or other sensitive query parameters in their raw (pre-sanitization) form.
These artifacts are **local-only** and must **not** be committed to git or shared externally.
Add them to `.gitignore` if you run `--paytm-debug` regularly.

### IRAS Login Diagnostics

Diagnostics are saved **automatically** whenever a CAPTCHA attempt fails — no flag
required. Two distinct failure modes are covered, each producing different artifacts.

**Path:** `data/iras/debug/login_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`

**Mode A — CAPTCHA image found but login failed (wrong prediction):**

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `attempt_NN_captcha.png` | CAPTCHA image sent to Claude Vision |
| `attempt_NN_prediction.txt` | Predicted text · timestamp · attempt number · result |
| `attempt_NN_after_submit.png` | Screenshot taken after clicking submit |
| `attempt_NN_error_text.txt` | Any visible error text scraped from the page |

**Mode B — CAPTCHA image not found on the page (e.g. page did not render):**

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `attempt_NN_no_captcha.png` | Full-page screenshot at time of search |
| `attempt_NN_no_captcha.html` | Full page HTML (capped at 500 KB) |
| `attempt_NN_no_captcha_url.txt` | Current URL · attempt number · img count · field visibility |
| `attempt_NN_no_captcha_text.txt` | Visible body text (capped at 10 000 chars) |
| `attempt_NN_no_captcha_images.txt` | All `<img>` tags with src/alt/id/class (up to 50) |
| `attempt_NN_no_captcha_candidates.txt` | Elements matching captcha-related id/class/src/alt, plus `<canvas>` |

Console also logs (Mode B): current URL · img tag count on page · username/password field visibility.

`data/` is in `.gitignore` and is never committed.
**Not saved (either mode):** passwords, cookies, session tokens, auth headers.

**Reading Mode A artifacts:** Open `attempt_NN_captcha.png` alongside `attempt_NN_prediction.txt`
to compare what Claude Vision predicted vs. what the image actually shows. If they
consistently agree but login still fails, the CAPTCHA image may be stale or IRAS is
rejecting the session for another reason. If prediction is clearly wrong, the model
may need a better prompt or the image selector may have changed.

**Reading Mode B artifacts:** Open `attempt_NN_no_captcha.png` and `attempt_NN_no_captcha.html`
to see what the page actually contained. Check `attempt_NN_no_captcha_images.txt` for all
`<img>` tags — if the CAPTCHA img is there but has no captcha-related src/id/class/alt, add
its actual attribute to the selector list. Check `attempt_NN_no_captcha_candidates.txt` for
canvas elements or elements with verify/security class names. If `url.txt` shows the page is
not the login page (e.g. redirected to an error page), the issue is upstream of CAPTCHA.

**Pre-login page readiness wait (added May 2026):** before starting CAPTCHA attempts,
`_autonomous_login()` calls `page.wait_for_selector()` with a comma-joined CSS selector
covering the password field, username inputs, `form`, CAPTCHA `img` keywords, and `canvas`.
Timeout: 20 s. This resolves the Railway/Linux Chromium issue where `wait_until="networkidle"`
fires before the JS-rendered login form has mounted. If the wait times out, a diagnostic
summary (URL, page title, HTML length, img count, body text excerpt, field visibility) is
logged to stdout, and attempt 1 then saves full no-CAPTCHA page artifacts as usual.

**CAPTCHA selector fallbacks (as of May 2026):** in addition to url/id/class/alt keyword
matching, the scraper also tries `img[src^='data:image']` (base64-embedded CAPTCHA) and
`canvas` (CAPTCHA rendered to HTML canvas rather than `<img>`).

### IRAS Manual CAPTCHA Fallback

If autonomous solving fails persistently, add `--iras-manual-captcha`:

```
python -X utf8 scrapers/daily_scrape.py --price-only --date 2026-05-22 --iras-manual-captcha
```

Behaviour:
1. Autonomous attempts run first (unchanged — up to `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = 3`).
2. If all fail, the login page is reloaded for a fresh CAPTCHA.
3. Fresh CAPTCHA saved to `data/iras/debug/login_<ts>/manual_captcha.png`.
4. Terminal prompts: `CAPTCHA text: `
5. User opens the image, types the characters, presses Enter.
6. Script submits and continues if login succeeds; exits non-zero otherwise.
7. Empty input or Ctrl-C aborts.

**Important constraints:**
- Default behavior is unchanged — autonomous-only, no blocking.
- Never pass `--iras-manual-captcha` in scheduled/unattended runs — it blocks indefinitely.
- Compatible with all IRAS-using modes: `all`, `--boundary-only`, `--atg-only`,
  `--price-only`, `--accounting-only`, `--completed-shift`.
- Not applicable to `--paytm-only` or `--sdms-only` (no IRAS login in those modes).

### ATG Rule

ATG/tank stock is a **live/current snapshot** of what is in the tanks right now.
It is not historical completed-shift accounting data.

- `--completed-shift` intentionally excludes ATG.
- Run ATG on its own schedule:
  ```
  python -X utf8 scrapers/daily_scrape.py --atg-only
  ```
- Ideal: every 30 minutes, or another multiple of 30 minutes, depending on operational need.
- Railway cron entrypoint: `scripts/run_atg_snapshot.py`. Schedule `*/30 * * * *` (UTC).
- Railway cron has **not yet been configured** in the Railway dashboard — runs are currently manual.

### Mode Summary

| Mode | Flag | `--date` meaning | Jobs |
|------|------|-----------------|------|
| Completed-shift | `--completed-shift` | Accounting op_date | Paytm + Price + missing boundaries + SDMS. ATG excluded. |
| Boundary only | `--boundary-only` | Shift boundary date | Price + ST + ISS. No Paytm/SDMS/ATG. |
| Accounting only | `--accounting-only` | Accounting op_date | Paytm + Price + SDMS. IRAS for Price only. |
| ATG snapshot | `--atg-only` | Ignored | Current tank levels only. |
| All (default) | _(none)_ | Shift boundary date | All 6 jobs in order (0 → 5). |
| Paytm only | `--paytm-only` | Accounting op_date | Paytm only. Skips if rows already in DB. No IRAS login. |
| Price only | `--price-only` | Accounting op_date | IRAS Price (PRM) only. Skips if all 4 products in DB. |
| SDMS only | `--sdms-only` | Accounting op_date | SDMS PAD only. Skips if row already in DB. No IRAS login. |

### Recommended Operational Runbook

> **Production target changed (July 2026): India VPS, not Railway cron.** See *India VPS
> Scraper Runner* below. The Railway-cron material in this section is retained for the web
> service and as historical reference — do not configure new scraper crons on Railway.

> **Full runbook (Railway-first, historical):** `docs/scrape_scheduling_runbook.md`
> **Shared Railway start command:** `scripts/railway_entrypoint.py` — dispatches on `PUMPVISION_SERVICE_ROLE`
> **Windows local fallback:** `scripts/run_completed_shift.ps1` · `scripts/run_atg_snapshot.ps1`

#### India VPS Scraper Runner (July 2026 — production path)

IRAS, Paytm and SDMS are India-geo-restricted and fail from Railway's US egress IP
(diagnosed July 2026; probe evidence in `scripts/vps_probe.py` runs). All scraper workloads
run from an AWS Lightsail Mumbai VPS; Railway keeps only the Flask web app + PostgreSQL.
The Bright Data proxy (`IRAS_PROXY_*` vars) is an emergency fallback only — never the default.

`.env` on the VPS holds all scraper secrets (verified identical to Railway's
`completed-shift-cron` service variables, July 2026). `PAYTM_HEADLESS=true` on the VPS.

Run commands are identical to the local ones below, executed on the VPS with
`.venv/bin/python`. **Phase 1 verified (10 Jul 2026):** full `--completed-shift` run for
op_date 2026-07-09 from the VPS wrote all four streams to Railway Postgres.

**Operational cautions (learned July 2026):**
- `--dry-run` is NOT a cheap preview — it performs the full browser scrape (Paytm login,
  IRAS CAPTCHA, SDMS) and only skips DB writes. Budget the same time/RAM as a real run.
- Never run two `daily_scrape.py` processes concurrently — overlapping runs interleave
  portal sessions and can fail each other (observed: Paytm UI-state collision).
- Launch long runs detached (`nohup ... > /data/logs/<name>.log 2>&1 &`) so SSH drops
  don't kill them.

**Phase 2 complete (11 Jul 2026): VPS cron is live.** Crontab for user `ubuntu`
(VPS clock is UTC):

```
0 1 * * *     /home/ubuntu/pumpvision/scripts/vps_run_completed_shift.sh  # 06:30 IST
30 0-18 * * * /home/ubuntu/pumpvision/scripts/vps_run_atg_snapshot.sh    # hourly, IST 06:00-00:00
0 7 * * 1-6   /home/ubuntu/pumpvision/scripts/vps_run_sdms_lookback.sh   # 12:30 IST CNG probe
0 10 * * 1-6  /home/ubuntu/pumpvision/scripts/vps_run_sdms_lookback.sh   # 15:30 IST CNG probe
35 11 * * 1-6 /home/ubuntu/pumpvision/scripts/vps_run_sdms_lookback.sh   # 17:05 IST CNG probe
```

**SDMS CNG lookback probes (added 14 Jul 2026):** CGD Rewa posts op_date D's CNG billing
row on D+1 between ~11:00–16:00 IST — never on Sunday (billing offices closed; Saturday's
and Sunday's rows both post Monday). Three probes (12:30 / 15:30 / 17:05 IST, Mon–Sat)
run `--sdms-only` over the last 3 op_dates so the CNG number lands at the earliest posting.
Once a date's CNG figure is in DB (or a zero-CNG row ages past `SDMS_CNG_LOOKBACK_DAYS = 3`),
the existence check reports COMPLETE and the probe costs three SELECTs — no browser.
The 17:05 slot is deliberately offset from the 11:30 UTC ATG snapshot to avoid lock races.
The morning completed-shift run also re-checks the same 3-day window as a safety net.

ATG runs hourly on the IST hour (UTC :30) with a deliberate blackout 01:00–05:00 IST —
the outlet is closed, tanks are static, and the Tanks screen keeps showing the latest
`tank_readings` row with its "AS OF" timestamp (midnight snapshot) until 06:00. Owner
decision, 11 Jul 2026.

Both wrappers share a flock on `/data/locks/daily_scrape.lock` so two
`daily_scrape.py` processes never overlap: completed-shift waits up to 25 min for the
lock; ATG is non-blocking and logs `SKIPPED` if a run is in flight (verified live —
cron ATG runs correctly skipped while a manual Paytm retry held the lock). Wrapper
logs: `/data/logs/completed_shift_<op_date>.log` and `/data/logs/atg_<IST-date>.log`
(30-day retention). The Python entrypoints (`scripts/run_completed_shift.py`,
`run_atg_snapshot.py`) load the repo-root `.env` themselves, so the crontab carries
no secrets.

**Paytm portal changes discovered 11 Jul 2026 (all handled in `paytm_exporter.py`):**
- The inline "Files to Download" panel is gone. Generated reports appear at
  **Reports & Invoices > Reports** (`/next/reports?type=payments`), one row per
  request with the requested duration and a presigned S3 CSV link (host
  `*.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com`). Step 7 polls that page, matching the exact
  duration text — stale rows are never picked up.
- A **"Merchant Configuration Issue — Please login again to continue"** modal can
  overlay a blank dashboard on an authenticated URL (MID/filter selectors never
  render). The scraper detects it, clicks "Login again" and re-logs-in. A fresh
  login triggers an OTP to the owner's phone + email; the Gmail IMAP fetch handles
  it automatically. Do not wipe `paytm_state.json` unless this modal recurs.
- Paytm sometimes rejects the report request with a **"Something went wrong"** toast
  (transient, server-side). The scraper now fails fast on it instead of polling 900s.
- `is_logged_in()` accepts an authenticated `/next/*` URL as fallback evidence — on
  this low-RAM VPS the MID text can miss its render window even when auth succeeded.

**Paytm existence check hardened (11 Jul 2026):** `COMPLETE` now requires
`max(transaction_datetime) >= op_date 20:00`, not just `COUNT(*) > 0`. Post-midnight
spillover rows assigned to the next op_date would otherwise permanently skip the
real full-shift download in scheduled runs. Earlier/partial data reports
`INCOMPLETE` and is re-scraped (safe — import dedupes by `paytm_txn_id`).

**Railway cron (historical / superseded for scrapers):**
`railway.json` sets `python -X utf8 scripts/railway_entrypoint.py` as the start command
for all Railway services. The service role is controlled by `PUMPVISION_SERVICE_ROLE`:

| Role | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `web` | Flask app via gunicorn (default if var not set) |
| `completed-shift` | Daily accounting scrape cron |
| `atg` | ATG tank snapshot cron (every 30 min) |
| `iras-probe` | Diagnostic: opens IRAS login page, prints DOM/network report, exits 0. No login. |

`railway.json` uses **DOCKERFILE** builder (switched from Nixpacks May 2026 to resolve
`libstdc++.so.6` missing on Railway Linux). Base image:
`mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.58.0-noble` — Ubuntu 24.04 + Python 3.12 +
Chromium pre-installed. `railway.json` contains only `builder` + `startCommand` in its
`build`/`deploy` blocks — healthcheck and restart-policy settings are intentionally omitted
because `railway.json` is shared by all services and those settings are web-only (cron
services do not serve HTTP). Configure them per-service in the Railway dashboard.
Railway cron has **not yet been configured** in the Railway dashboard.

| Schedule | Railway start command | Cron (UTC) | Notes |
|----------|-----------------------|------------|-------|
| Once daily, after 06:00 IST | `python -X utf8 scripts/run_completed_shift.py` | `0 1 * * *` | 01:00 UTC = 06:30 IST; op\_date auto-calculated in IST |
| Every 30 minutes | `python -X utf8 scripts/run_atg_snapshot.py` | `*/30 * * * *` | ATG live snapshot; separate from completed-shift |

**Standard daily workflow (manual until scheduling is live):**

```bash
# Run after 06:10 on YYYY-MM-DD for the shift that just closed (op_date = yesterday)
python -X utf8 scrapers/daily_scrape.py --completed-shift --date YYYY-MM-DD

# Separately, to refresh tank levels
python -X utf8 scrapers/daily_scrape.py --atg-only
```

**If a source fails in the completed-shift run:**

```bash
# Retry Paytm only (if Paytm download failed or timed out)
python -X utf8 scrapers/daily_scrape.py --paytm-only --date YYYY-MM-DD

# Retry Paytm with extended wait (if report generation is slow)
python -X utf8 scrapers/daily_scrape.py --paytm-only --date YYYY-MM-DD --paytm-wait-seconds 180

# Retry Price only (if IRAS CAPTCHA failed)
python -X utf8 scrapers/daily_scrape.py --price-only --date YYYY-MM-DD

# Retry Price with manual CAPTCHA fallback (if autonomous solving keeps failing)
python -X utf8 scrapers/daily_scrape.py --price-only --date YYYY-MM-DD --iras-manual-captcha

# Retry SDMS only (if SDMS failed)
python -X utf8 scrapers/daily_scrape.py --sdms-only --date YYYY-MM-DD
```

**Dry-run (preview without writing to DB):**

```bash
python -X utf8 scrapers/daily_scrape.py --completed-shift --date YYYY-MM-DD --dry-run
```

**Paytm manual import (if CSV already exists locally):**

```bash
python -X utf8 scrapers/import_paytm_csv.py data/paytm/paytm_YYYY-MM-DD.csv
```

## Critical Business Logic

### Operational Day: 06:00 to 05:59
RSPs effective 06:00:00 → 05:59:59 next day. Shift Totalizer is midnight-to-midnight.
Boundary mode resolves the mismatch.

### Boundary Mode Algorithm
1. XG pre-check: nozzle 11 movement ≤ 7L → carry forward, skip ISS. > 7L → ISS search.
2. ISS backward search 05:30–06:00 for nozzles 7, 15, 16, 17, 18.
3. Stop when all 5 resolved or 48 windows checked.
XG threshold: 5L pump test + 2L buffer = 7L.

**`daily_scrape.py --date YYYY-MM-DD` semantics:**
`--date 2026-05-22` resolves the 06:00 boundary for `operational_date = 2026-05-22`.
It writes a `NozzleTotalizer` row with `operational_date = 2026-05-22` (the 06:00 reading).
The first backward ISS search window is 2026-05-22 05:30 → 06:00.
To display fuel sales for 21 May on the owner dashboard, you need **two consecutive runs**:
`--date 2026-05-21` (opening boundary) and `--date 2026-05-22` (closing boundary).

### Price Lookup (liquid fuel only)
Never hardcode. Join transaction datetime to Price table:
match Product Code + datetime in [Effective From 06:00, Effective To 05:59:59].
CNG: read from `app_settings.cng_rsp_per_kg` — not from Price table.

### Totalizer Facts
Hardware odometers, cumulative since installation. Only increase, never reset.
Closing > opening always. Gap = unreported dispensing (tamper signal).

### Pump Tests (liquid fuel only, not CNG)
5L/nozzle every ~08:20, all 6 liquid nozzles. ISS type "Pump Test (105)".
Fuel returns to tank — not a sale. Deducted from totalizer diff before net sales.

### Fuel Adulteration Check
Depot density (RDB Invoice) → Tanker hydrometer (Receipt Density) → Post-decant (Density Records).
Alert if depot density vs hydrometer delta ≥ 5%.

### `get_operational_date()`
`services/operational.py`. Before 06:00 → yesterday. At/after 06:00 → today.
Used **only** in attendant home nudge.
Shift close uses `_shift_op_date() = date.today() − 1` (always yesterday). Do not conflate.

### Owner Dashboard Accounting Date Semantics

**The owner dashboard does not show "today so far." It shows the last completed operational
shift.** Do not describe it as live intraday accounting.

The outlet operational day runs 06:00 → 05:59/06:00 next calendar day.
When the owner opens the dashboard on calendar day D, the accounting view is:

> **D−1 06:00 → D 06:00** (i.e., `op_date = D − 1`)

**Example:** If today is 22 May 2026, the dashboard shows accounting data for
21 May 2026 06:00 → 22 May 2026 06:00. In DB terms: `op_date = 2026-05-21`.

**NozzleTotalizer requirement:** Fuel sales for `op_date = 2026-05-21` require two rows:

| `operational_date` | Role |
|--------------------|------|
| 2026-05-21 | Opening boundary (06:00 totalizer reading) |
| 2026-05-22 | Closing boundary (06:00 totalizer reading) |

Fuel litres = totalizer at 2026-05-22 06:00 − totalizer at 2026-05-21 06:00 − pump tests.
A single scraper run produces one boundary row. Two consecutive dates must both be scraped
before any fuel volume can appear on the dashboard.

In code: `dashboard_bp.index()` hardcodes `op_date = date.today() - timedelta(days=1)`.
`_product_sales(op_date)` queries `NozzleTotalizer` for `op_date` (opening) and `op_date + 1`
(closing). If either row is missing, that product shows 0 L.

### Stock Watch Calculation (owner dashboard)
Rolling 7-day avg daily consumption per product from ISS data.
Days remaining = current ATG volume ÷ avg daily consumption.
Order-by date = today + days_remaining − 2 (2-day depot lead time).
Show stock watch card only if any product ≤ 7 days. Hidden if all > 7 days.

## Production Data Status (Railway PostgreSQL)

Last updated: 14 July 2026.

### CGD/CNG late-posting mystery RESOLVED (14 Jul 2026)

The missing CNG rows for 07-11/07-12 were **late posting by CGD Rewa**, not a supply stop:
direct re-scrapes on 14 Jul found CNG 2,340.58 kg (07-11) and 2,347.11 kg (07-12) — both
now upserted in `sdms_summaries`. Permanent fix shipped in `daily_scrape.py`: SDMS existence
check treats a zero-CNG row as `INCOMPLETE` for `SDMS_CNG_LOOKBACK_DAYS = 3`, and
`--completed-shift` re-checks the 3 prior op_dates each run. Also learned:
`cng_shift_readings` is empty — attendants never submit CNG readings at shift close, so
there is no independent CNG cross-check until that habit starts.

### op_date 2026-07-13 — complete except CNG (awaiting late CGD posting)

Cron fired 14 Jul 06:30 IST, finished 06:43 IST, fully hands-off (third clean day; IRAS
attempt-1 login). Closing boundary 2026-07-14 all 6 nozzles · Price all 4 products · Paytm
SUCCEEDED · SDMS fleet ₹3,880 (2 txns), no CGD row yet — the new lookback will pick up the
CNG figure automatically within 3 days.

### op_date 2026-07-12 — fully complete (first fully hands-off cron day)

Cron fired 13 Jul 06:30 IST and finished 06:44 IST with zero manual intervention — the
first clean end-to-end automatic day. The stale-CAPTCHA fix (commit `818bf9c`) is verified:
IRAS login succeeded on **attempt 1**. All four streams confirmed directly in Railway
Postgres: closing boundary 2026-07-13 all 6 nozzles · Price all 4 products · Paytm 403 rows
(latest txn 23:00) · SDMS fleet ₹9,806.40 (3 txns). **No CGD/CNG billing row for the second
day running** (07-11 and 07-12) — dashboard CNG shows nothing for these dates; watch whether
CGD posts late or has stopped appearing on the PAD statement.

### op_date 2026-07-11 — fully complete (first automatic VPS cron day)

Cron fired on schedule 12 Jul 06:30 IST: Paytm + SDMS succeeded; IRAS failed 3/3 CAPTCHAs
(transient — attempts 2–3 were read correctly but rejected; stale-CAPTCHA race suspected
and fixed same day, commit `818bf9c`). Same-day manual re-run of the wrapper filled Price
+ closing boundary 2026-07-12. All four streams verified in DB. SDMS note: fleet ₹2,240
(3 txns), **no CGD/CNG billing row for 2026-07-11 on the PAD statement** — dashboard CNG
for this date shows nothing until/unless SDMS posts it.

### op_date 2026-07-10 — fully complete

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Opening boundary 2026-07-10 | ✓ (from Phase 1) |
| Closing boundary 2026-07-11 | ✓ All 6 nozzles |
| SDMS PAD 2026-07-10 | ✓ Fleet ₹15,395.80 (4 txns) · CNG 1,951.46 kg |
| Paytm 2026-07-10 | ✓ 556 rows (06:09→23:31) + 187 spillover rows on op_date 07-11; no duplicates |
| Price 2026-07-10 | ✓ Resolved 12 Jul — all 4 products in DB (landed alongside the 07-11 Price scrape). Rates static since 18 Jun (HS 101.16 · MS 116.02 · X2 125.36 · XG 106.41) |

The 187 Paytm rows on op_date 2026-07-11 are correct per the 06:00 rule (post-midnight
transactions belong to the next op_date's CSV window) and will NOT block the 07-11 cron
download thanks to the hardened existence check.

### op_date 2026-07-09 — fully complete (first India VPS run)

First end-to-end `--completed-shift` run from the India VPS (Phase 1 gate). All streams
verified directly in Railway Postgres:

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Opening boundary 2026-07-09 | ✓ All 6 nozzles |
| Closing boundary 2026-07-10 | ✓ All 6 nozzles |
| Price for 2026-07-09 | ✓ All 4 products |
| SDMS PAD for 2026-07-09 | ✓ Fleet ₹10,590.60 · CNG 2,120.41 kg |
| Paytm | ✓ 592 rows imported (414 op_date 07-09 + 178 op_date 07-10) |

Open observation: 178 of the 592 Paytm rows were assigned `operational_date = 2026-07-10`
although the CSV covered the 2026-07-09 shift window (06:00 → 05:59). This is the importer's
existing date-assignment logic, not a VPS issue — review if cash reconciliation ever looks
off by roughly the post-midnight POS amount.

### op_date 2026-05-21 — fully verified

Owner dashboard proof-of-life succeeded for accounting op_date **2026-05-21**
(shift window 2026-05-21 06:00 → 2026-05-22 06:00). All major data streams verified:

| Table | Status |
|-------|--------|
| `nozzle_totalizers` | ✓ Opening boundary 2026-05-21 + closing boundary 2026-05-22 present |
| `iras_prices` | ✓ Price rows covering 2026-05-21 present |
| `paytm_transactions` | ✓ Rows for 2026-05-21 present |
| `tank_readings` | ✓ ATG snapshot populated |
| `sdms_summaries` | ✓ CNG + fleet data for 2026-05-21 present |

### op_date 2026-05-20 — fully complete

Completed-shift live test for op_date **2026-05-20** (shift window 2026-05-20 06:00 → 2026-05-21 05:59):

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Opening boundary 2026-05-20 | ✓ Scraped and saved |
| Closing boundary 2026-05-21 | ✓ Already present (COMPLETE) — skipped |
| Price for 2026-05-20 | ✓ Downloaded and saved |
| SDMS PAD for 2026-05-20 | ✓ Downloaded and saved |
| Paytm for 2026-05-20 | ✓ 520 rows imported via `import_paytm_csv.py` |

Owner dashboard shows data for 2026-05-20. All streams complete.

### Known IRAS Reliability Issue (May 2026)

In recent runs, Paytm succeeded but the subsequent IRAS session failed after 3 CAPTCHA
attempts. This is **not necessarily a credentials problem** — IRAS CAPTCHA is intermittently
difficult, and repeated attempts sometimes fail even with correct login details.

**If IRAS fails after Paytm succeeds:**

1. Check the debug artifacts (auto-saved — see *IRAS Login Diagnostics* below).
2. Retry with `--price-only` — Paytm is already in DB and will be skipped.
3. If failure recurs and autonomous solving keeps failing, use `--iras-manual-captcha`
   to fall back to manual terminal entry after autonomous attempts are exhausted.

### Backfill command reference

To populate any op_date from scratch (boundaries + Price + Paytm + SDMS):
```
python -X utf8 scrapers/daily_scrape.py --completed-shift --date YYYY-MM-DD
```

To populate ATG (run separately — tank stock is a live snapshot, not historical):
```
python -X utf8 scrapers/daily_scrape.py --atg-only
```

**Automated scheduled scraping is LIVE on the India VPS (11 Jul 2026).** Completed-shift
runs daily at 01:00 UTC (06:30 IST) and ATG every 30 minutes, via cron on the VPS —
see *India VPS Scraper Runner*. Railway cron for scrapers is superseded.
**Phase 3 complete (11 Jul 2026):** Railway cron services (`completed-shift-cron`,
`atg-cron`) and the detached `atg-debug-data` volume deleted via Railway CLI. Railway
now runs only the `web` service + Postgres.

## Architecture

### Single Tree, Three Branches
One Flask app, one DB, one deployment. Three roles via `users.role`.

### Design System Phases (historical reference)
- Phase 1 ✓ — design-system.css + macros/ui.html + base.html
- Phase 2 ✓ — login drum-roll animation
- Phase 3 ✓ — all 9 attendant screens reskinned
- Phase 4 — manager screens (new design from start)
- Phase 5 — owner screens (`Owner_Screens.html` as visual reference)

### Cloud Deployment
Railway (paid tier), PostgreSQL. Mobile-first PWA. Bind `0.0.0.0` in dev.
Auto-deploys on push to `main`.

### Local Dev
`start.bat` uses full Python path: `C:\Users\Rishab 2\AppData\Local\Python\bin\python.exe`
(Windows Store `python` stub does not work.) Local login: `rishab` / `changeme`.

**Stale process warning (Windows):** Flask `--debug` mode spawns a stat-reloader parent + worker
child. Multiple `start` calls accumulate stale processes, all listening on port 5000. Symptoms:
intermittent 500 errors or old code being served. Fix: use PowerShell `Stop-Process` to kill all
Python PIDs before restarting — `taskkill` from Bash silently fails on Windows.
Never run the Flask dev server via `run_in_background` in a Claude session; always start it in a
visible terminal so you can kill it cleanly.

### Database
SQLAlchemy ORM only — no raw SQL. `DATABASE_URL` env var switches SQLite ↔ PostgreSQL.
Flask-Migrate / Alembic for all schema changes.

**Connection pool hardening (Railway PostgreSQL):** `SQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_OPTIONS` is set in
`create_app()` for PostgreSQL only (`pool_pre_ping=True`, `pool_recycle=300`). This prevents
`SSL error: decryption failed or bad record mac` errors caused by stale pooled connections
after Railway idle-connection timeouts. SQLite is unaffected.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python / Flask (app factory, blueprints)
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy + Flask-Migrate
- **Frontend:** Jinja2 + Tailwind CSS (mobile-first)
- **Auth:** Flask-Login (session-based)
- **PDF:** ReportLab (NOT WeasyPrint — Windows incompatibility)
- **Scraping:** Playwright async + Claude Vision API (CAPTCHA). Production runtime: Docker image `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.58.0-noble` — Chromium + all system dependencies (libstdc++, libnss, libgbm, etc.) pre-installed. No separate `playwright install --with-deps` step needed.
- **Deployment:** Railway (Dockerfile builder — switched from Nixpacks May 2026)

## Design System

### Active Implementation
Full spec: `docs/design/Pumpvision_Design_System.html`
CSS: `pumpvision/static/css/design-system.css`
Macros: `pumpvision/templates/macros/ui.html`

**Owner screens 10 and 15 deviate from the v0.1 design system.**
Use `docs/design/Owner_Screens.html` as the sole visual and CSS reference for those
two screens. Extract all tokens, colors, and component styles from that file directly.
Login and attendant screens retain the original design system.

### Design Tokens (design-system.css, used for login + attendant)
- `--paper-*` (50–500): warm substrate
- `--ink-*` (500–900): navy
- `--saffron-*` (100–700): energy accent — one CTA per screen max
- `--ok-*` / `--warn-*` / `--error-*`: status states
- Product layer: `--hsd-*` (green) · `--ms-*` (brick red) · `--x2-*` (purple) · `--xg-*` (teal)

### Typography
- **Newsreader** — serif headings (login + attendant)
- **IBM Plex Sans** — UI labels, body, nav
- **JetBrains Mono** — all operational numbers (`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`)
- **Major Mono Display** — wordmark only

### Macros (`{% from 'macros/ui.html' import … %}`)
totalizer · product_chip · status_chip · field · select_field · textarea_field ·
totalizer_field · card · section_rule · receipt_row · back_btn · screen_topbar

### Login Animation
10 drum cells → PUMPVISION. `document.fonts.ready` gate required.
680ms–2335ms left→right, `cubic-bezier(0.04,0.06,0,1)`. Hero exits → form fades 80ms later.

### Forbidden — Do Not Invent
- Efficiency scores, accuracy %, quality metrics
- "Auto-settlement", "Automated Payouts", "Settlement batches"
- Multi-user collaboration features
- "Live Alerts", "STATION OS", "Diagnostics"
- WhatsApp/SMS (deferred)
- "Fleet Account" or "Corporate Account" types
- Any branding other than Pumpvision
- Hardware features that don't exist (temperature, pressure, flow rate)
- Time selector (Today/Week/Month) on owner dashboard
- 7-day revenue bar chart on owner dashboard
- Circular tank rings — horizontal fill bars only
- "Reconcile" as nav label or screen
- Reconciliation open items workflow
- "Variance" screen — needs delivery scraper (Stage 3)
- Aggregate total volume across all products
- Manager fleet card entry UI

## Screen Inventory

PNG refs in `docs/screens/`. **Owner screens 10 + 15: use `docs/design/Owner_Screens.html`.**

---

### Auth

#### `01_login.png` ✓
**Route:** `GET/POST /login`
Drum-roll animation → form. Newsreader italic heading, saffron left-border card, saffron CTA.

---

### Attendant Branch ✓ All implemented

Nav: Home · Activity · Profile

#### `02_attendant_home.png` ✓
**Route:** `GET /` (role=attendant)
Shift status nudge (ok/warn). Two action cards: Log Credit Sale · Close Shift.

#### `03_select_customer.png` ✓
**Route:** `GET /attendant/credit/select-customer`

Revenue = kg_sold × `cng_rsp_per_kg`. CNG optional — does not block 6-nozzle submit.

---

### Manager Branch — Stage 1

Nav: Home · Expenses · Payments · More
(Fleet tab removed — no manual fleet entry.)

#### Manager home
**Route:** `GET /manager/`
Daily checklist. Resets each operational day.
Items: Expenses (warn/ok) · Pending payment recordings · Overdue items.

#### Log expense
**Route:** `GET/POST /manager/expense`
Amount · category · description · date → `expenses`

#### Record payment received
**Route:** `GET/POST /manager/payment`
Customer picker · amount · mode (Cash/Cheque/Bank Transfer) · reference.
Cash/Cheque → confirmed. Bank Transfer → pending_verification.

---

### Owner Branch — Stage 1

Nav: Home · Tanks · Credit · Summary · More

#### `10_owner_dashboard.png` ✓
**Route:** `GET /` (role=owner)
**Design ref: `docs/design/Owner_Screens.html` screen 10 — implemented.**

Data wiring:
- Revenue: ISS (litres × RSP per product) + SDMS CNG (`_cng_sdms()`, kg × rsp/kg)
- Cash in hand: Revenue − Paytm − Credit − Fleet card (derived)
- Per-product breakdown: ISS per product code + CNG from SDMS DB via `_cng_sdms()` (JSON fallback)
- Stock watch: rolling 7-day consumption from ISS → days remaining → order-by date.
  Card only appears when any product ≤ 7 days. Hidden otherwise.
- Price ticker: RSP from Price table (liquid) + `cng_rsp_per_kg` (CNG)

#### `11_owner_tanks.png` — ✓ Done
**Route:** `GET /tanks`
Latest `tank_readings` per tank. "AS OF HH:MM" timestamp.
Fill bar (product color) · % · volume · capacity · days left.
Days left: > 7 default · 3–7 warn-600 · ≤ 2 error-600.
No data state: "No ATG reading" shown per card.
Note: "Order soon" chip and XG probe warning are deferred — not currently shown.

#### Credit home ✓ Done

Cross-customer credit activity view. Recent transactions across all accounts.

#### `12_credit_customer_list.png` ✓ Done
**Route:** `GET /credit/customers`
Summary: Total Outstanding + Overdue. Filter chips: All / Over 80% / Overdue / Suspended.
Customer cards: avatar · name · vehicles · utilisation bar · balance.
Border: < 70% default · 70–80% warn-600 · > 80% error-600. Sticky "+ Add customer".

#### `13_credit_customer_detail.png` — ✓ Done
**Route:** `GET /credit/customers/<id>`
Header: name · balance · utilisation pill. Tabs: Activity · Invoices · Receipts.
Owner view is read-only. Payment recording is manager-side (manager branch, Stage 1).
Activity feed: fuel + payments (chronological). Invoices and receipts shown in separate tabs.

#### `14_credit_customer_add.png` ✓ Done
**Route:** `GET/POST /credit/customers/new` and `/<id>/edit`
Company name · account ID + GST · fleet manager · contact · credit limit · payment terms (15/30/45).
Vehicles: "+ Add vehicle" dashed button. "Suspend account" destructive: hidden in New, visible in Edit.

#### `15_owner_daily_summary.png` ✓
**Route:** `GET /summary` and `GET /summary/<date_str>`
**Design ref: `docs/design/Owner_Screens.html` screen 15 — implemented.**

Data wiring (full calculation chain):

1. **FUEL SALES** — one row per product (HS / MS / X2 / XG / CNG):
   Liquid: ISS litres × RSP from Price table.
   CNG: kg_sold × rsp_per_kg from `_cng_sdms(op_date)` — reads SDMS DB first, JSON fallback.
   → Subtotal: GROSS FUEL SALES

2. **LUBE SALES** — cash lube from `lube_transactions` for the day.
   Show "—" + "Logging not active" until Stage 2 manager flow is live.

3. **GROSS REVENUE** — fuel + lube (totalizer per Owner_Screens.html)

4. **DEDUCTIONS:**
   - Credit extended: sum of credit fuel + credit lube for the day
   - POS (UPI + Card): Paytm data for the day, combined
   - Fleet card: SDMS PAD data for the day
   - Expenses: `expenses` sum for the day ("—" if none logged)

5. **CASH IN HAND** — derived. Totalizer at bottom of receipt card.

Date nav: ← [date] → via URL param. Default: today's operational date.
No data → "No data for [date]" with nav still present.
PDF via ReportLab matching on-screen layout. "Share" (ghost) + "Print / Save PDF" (saffron CTA).

---

## Delivery Workflow

1. IOC depot loads tanker → RDB SAP Invoice
2. Tanker arrives → hydrometer readings per chamber → Receipt Density Records
3. Decanting → TT Receipt (ATG before/after)
4. Post-decant → Density Records

Trucks: MP17HH4740 (regular) · MP53HA2180 · MP20ZQ9560. Supply point: Depot 3356.
**MP17HH4740 is the supply tanker — NOT a customer vehicle.**

---

## Known Anomalies
- Receipt 1107 (25 Mar 2026): 463L MS, no invoice/truck/density. Suspicious.
- Product XP (legacy — predates X2): ignore in all reporting.

## Observed Operating Patterns
- Outlet closes ~01:00–06:00. No XG sold midnight–06:00.
- Nozzle 16 (HS2): very low volume (~25L/day) — possible overflow-only usage.
- Pump tests: ~08:20, 5L/nozzle, all 6 liquid nozzles, every day.

## Agentic Routing (project override)

The fable-advisor orchestration skill is active — all rules apply except one substitution:
- Routine lane: `implementer` (Sonnet 4.6) replaces `grok-implementer` (Grok CLI not installed)
- Subtle lane: `implementer-opus` (Opus 4.8) for tasks where a Sonnet miss is expensive
- Cross-vendor lane: `codex-implementer` (GPT-5.6 Sol) — unchanged
- Judgment lane: `fable-advisor` (Fable 5) — unchanged

Spec contract (all five required on every delegation):
Objective · Files · Interfaces · Constraints · Verification command

Cost discipline: emit specs and decisions only. No narration. Delegate immediately.
